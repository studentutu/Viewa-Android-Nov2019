//BASIC USAGE
// the Handheld.PlayFullScreenMovie play mobile videos *only on mobile device, not works on editor
// YoutubeVideo.Instance.RequestVideo is everithing you need to get the video
// If you want to play the video on textures, just like a outdor(example) in game or a 360 degree video(using a sphere scene of Easy Movie Texture) you need a third part asset, Easy Movie Texture works perfectly with that plugin, if you have Easy Movie Texture take a look at YoutubeEasyMovieTexture script
// I think you can do that using a free plugin too, not tested yet but you can try to use vuforia to play video as texture.

		{
            Handheld.PlayFullScreenMovie(YoutubeVideo.Instance.RequestVideo(videoId1, 720)); //if the second parameter is 0 will use the YoutubeVideo.cs quality settings
            Debug.Log("The video only plays on mobile device, if you receive one big url on console all it's ok");
		}
		if(GUI.Button(new Rect(0,Screen.height/2,Screen.width,Screen.height/2),"Load Video 2"))
